# esther-notebooks

Jupyter notebooks documenting some of the initial trials in defining the optimization problem.

## `linear_programming.ipynb`
The simplest (and probably fastest) optimization problem that at least somewhat describes the dynamics. Anyhow, the conclusion from this trial was that the problem does not lend itself well to linearization.

## `nonlinear_opt.ipynb`
A fully nonlinear setup utilizing a Sequential Quadratic Programming solver (SLSQP).
